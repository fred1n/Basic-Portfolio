              I am currently attending a web development BootCamp at University of Texas in Austin, 
              Texas.  I work as a Service Delivery Manager for Accenture Federal Services (AFS). I’m
              married with three girls…all three out of college and have jobs.  Two already of the 
              house and one still at home but has a job. In my book, I've successfully made sure that 
              my kids are educated, have jobs and are no longer fully dependent on me.  
          <br />
          <br />
            My wifes says I'm a workaholics.  My day usually starts out with a workout around five 
            in the morning that will last between forty-five minutes to an hour.  I shower eat 
            breakfast and walk to work.  I work remote meaning that my office is at home. I start with
            planning my to-do list for the day, reading and responding to emails, and planning for 
            calls to be made that day. For emails that I need to do research, I send out an initial email
            to inform the requestor that their email has been received and they will be contacted later 
            with details on their request.  We use Skype as our messenger so I also respond to on-demand 
            requests and/or get on calls as needed.  I manage two internal assets within AFS that combined
            have about sixty to eighty projects.
