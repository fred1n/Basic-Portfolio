          <p>
              I am currently attending a web development BootCamp at University of Texas in Austin, 
              Texas.  I work as a Service Delivery Manager for Accenture Federal Services (AFS). I’m
              married with three girls…all three are out of college and have jobs.  
          <br />
          <br />
            My wifes says I'm a workaholic. I work remote meaning that my office is at home. I start with
            planning my to-do list for the day, reading and responding to emails, and planning for 
            calls to be made that day. For emails that I need to do research, I send out an initial email
            to inform the requestor that their email has been received and they will be contacted later 
            with details on their request.  We use Skype as our messenger so I also respond to on-demand 
            requests and/or get on calls as needed.  I manage two internal assets within AFS that combined
            have about sixty to eighty 
            projects.
